## colab notifier
**colab notifier** is a Google Chrome extension that notifies you when cells are finished running.

## Description
The days of repeatedly checking your Google Colaboratory notebooks are over. You can now safely enjoy watching YouTube videos while your models are training without you having to check whether or not your notebook has finished running. 

Using **colab notifier** you will get notified when your cells are finished after running longer than a certain threshold set by you. You can get notified with a sound, a message, or both.
